> Playwright suggests using CSS locator instead of XPath.

### CSS Selectors:
1. If id is present
   
   `#id` | `tagname#id`

2. If class name is present
   
   `.class` | `tagname.class`

3. Generate css selector based on attribute
   
   `[attribute='value']`
   (With regEx -> `[attribute*='val']`)

4. Traversing from parent to child element
   
   `parentTagName childTagName`

5. Based on text
    
   `text='abc'` | `tag:has-text='abc'`
